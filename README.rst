**synonym** is nice because it allows you stay in the console.
If you love editing articles, essays and blogs using a console-based text editor, and from time to time 
find yourself searching
synonyms for verbs and adjectives, then it is for you.

Features
--------

* If the word was mispelled, **synonym** would give a guess.

* Limiting to a specific property (n., v., adj., adv.) is possible.

* **synonym** uses cache by default for faster access. Caching can be disabled by setting `SYNONYM_DISABLE_CACHE` environment variable. The cache is in `~/.cache/howdoi`.

* Powered by:

* Beautiful terminal colors thanks to `crayons <https://github.com/kennethreitz/crayons>`_.

* Inspired by `howdoi <https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi>`_
